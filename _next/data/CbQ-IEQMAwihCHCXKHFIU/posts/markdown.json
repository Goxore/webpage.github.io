Most of the keybindings\nstand for English words.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>d - delete</p>\n<p>a - append</p>\n<p>i -insert</p>\n<p>c - change</p>\n<p>f - find</p>\n<p>y - yank (copy)</p>\n<p>p - paste</p>\n<p>w - word</p>\n<p>b - back</p>\n<p>You can not only use those keybindings on their own, but also combine them\nto form new ones</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>dw - delete word</p>\n<p>di( - delete in ()</p>\n<p>yw - yank word</p>\n<p>You might have noticed that i havent used any  or  keys\nthroughout the article, and that's because Vim is actually a modal text editor.\nIt means that it uses different modes, that determine what your keys will do.\nVim has quite a few different modes, but for beginners i reccomend at first concentrating on\nNormal Insert and Visual modes, that are triggered by , ,  keys respectively.</p>\n<h3>More about Modes</h3>\n<p>When you first open Vim, you will be put in Normal mode, the one where all of your keys\nwon't be inseted into the text file, but will be used to trigger commands.\nin this mode you can navigate through your file with hjkl or arrow keys.</p>\n<p>to enter insert mode press  key, and to exit insert mode press </p>\n<p>While being in the Normal mode, you can switch to visual mode with  key.\nIt lets you select a portion of text, and then manipulate it with Normal mode keys.\nSelecting the text and pressing  will delete(cut) it,  will yank(copy) it,\n&#x3C;:> will let you permorm a command on it.</p>\n<h3>key additions</h3>\n<p>Most Vim keys have a different effect when are used in uppercase.  key selects text, but\n key selects whole line,  key deletes selection, but  key deletes all text to the end of the line,\n key lets you insert text on your cursor position,\nbut  key sends your cursor to the beginning of the line\nand activates insert mode.</p>\n<h2>Why learn Vim in 2022?</h2>\n<p>Vim might sound like a relic of the past, but it is not less capable than modern text editors.\nIt has been around for decades, so you can easily get documentation on it through your favourite\nsearch engine, ot with :h command right in it.\nWith plugins like emmet, NERDTree and Coc you can make your vim a powerful code editor,\nand by customizing it's config you can optimize workflow with it to your liking.</p>\n<p>Vim is preffered by many proffesionals in tech industry, so\nyou can spot it's keybindings in all sorts of CLI programs, and it is not going away\nany time soon.</p>\n<p>I had a blast learning Vim keybindings, commands and hidden features, and really hope I might\ninspire someone to also do so!</p>\n","title":"Why I learned vim in 2021","date":"2022-01-12"}},"__N_SSG":true}
